Welcome!

üëã Hi, my name is Sambhav Khanna and I'm a third-year student at the **University of Waterloo**, majoring in **Computer Science**, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, and **expected to graduate in the Spring of 2027**. The details of the courses I have taken so far can be found at, [[courses|courses]].

üíª I'm proficient in full-stack development, leveraging Python, Node.js, C, and C++ for back-end applications, Next.js and Streamlit for front-end design, Postgres SQL, MongoDB and Firebase for database management, and Vercel, Google Cloud, AWS, and Azure for cloud hosting!

‚≠ê I'm enthusiastic about Software Development and recently I have been learning about LLMs, RAG systems, agentic systems and how AI integrated software is developed. I have used various opensource LLM APIs that I have brought locally to my machine using Ollama and Docker. I have also worked with multi-modal LLM APIs including Gemini 1.5 Pro, GPT-4-turbo. The details of the projects I have made so far can be found at, [[projects|projects]].

üíº I have successfully completed two internships so far and currently interning at Radical AI as a SWE intern, working on their AI agent. I'm working with Next.js and Python, developing their function calling pipeline. The complete details of my work experiences can be found at, [[experience|experiences]].

‚úçÔ∏è In my free time, I like to sketch, paint, play badminton and listen to rap (J Cole is the üêê). I also enjoy participating in hackathons and building creative solutions to everyday problems. Some of my artwork can be found at, [[artwork|artwork]].

üìñ In my final year at highschool, I competed in the Joint Entrance Exam(JEE) Mains and Advanced, which are admission tests for the Indian Institute of Technology(IIT). I received a rank of 3,890 out of 1,026,799 (in top 0.43%) in JEE Mains and a rank of 5,161 out of 155,538 (in top 3.3%) in JEE Advanced, getting selected into IIT Kharargpur for Mechanical Engineering.

I had a final average of 97% in highschool in a total of 5 subjects and, receieved President's Scholarship and International Mathematics Scholarship worth a total of 25,000 CAD by the University of Waterloo.
